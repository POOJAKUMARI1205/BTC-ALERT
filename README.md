# BTC-ALERT
Create a price alert application that triggers an email when the userâ€™s target price is achieved. Say, the current price of BTC is 28,000$, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of 33,000$. The application should send an email to the user when the price of BTC reaches 33,000$. Similarly, say, the currency price of BTC is 35,000$, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of 33,000$. The application should send an email when the price of BTC reaches 33,000$.
